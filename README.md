# README - DeepThought

## Introduction

This package provides functions for computations in finitely generated
nilpotent groups given by a suitable presentation. These computations use
polynomials which are computed using the Deep Thought algorithm. For more
information see the documentation.

## Issues

For questions, remarks and issues please use the [issue tracker](
https://github.com/gap-packages/DeepThought/issues). 

## Tests

Test functions can be found in the /tst subdirectory. Note that some files
have the ending .tstlong. Running them may take a while.
